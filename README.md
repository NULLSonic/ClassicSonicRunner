## What's Classic Sonic Runners?
Classic Sonic Runners (CSRunner or CSR for short.) is a remake of Sonic Runners in Godot, but with classic Sonic characters. If you don't know what Sonic Runners is lemme explain it real quick.

## What was Sonic Runners?
Sonic Runners was a free to play sidescrolling endless runner game for Android and iOS that was published in 2015 and got discountinued in 2016 and closing it's servers. And since Sonic Runners needed an all time online connection to the server you couldn't play it at all anymore. The gameplay was really easy to understand.
The player-character was constantly running forward and. To avoid obstacles and enemies the player needed to touch the screen in order to make the player-character jump. The game had a lot of characters from the Sonic franchise Everybody was split into 3 play styles.

- Speed: The player was able to perform a triple jump with this character
- Fly: The player was able to jump 8 eights and then slowly descend down to the ground.
- Power: The player was able to perform a dash attack which could destroy metal badniks.

Every character type also had their own bonuses:

- Hero: Distance Bonus
- Dark: Score Bonus
- Chaotix: Ring Bonux
- Rose: Animal Bonus
- Mech: Enemy Bonus
- Easy: Game speed cut and Total score cut (Not really a bonus but if you wanted slower gameplay)
- Wild: Distance bonus and Animal bonus
- Future: Score Bonus and game speed cut

## Why is this project open source?
Because:
- A: To see if any forks would be made with this (not actual forks that you can eat it. I mean GitHub Forks, cloning the repo and adding custom stuff.)
- B: Having a modding community
- And C: Keeping y'alls game up to date. With an ingame Updator. Well it won't update your game it will just tell you to go and update it.

## Modding Help
Will be added when the first playable version releases. (Might use the GitHub Repo Wiki for that.)

## Planned Stuff (Not To Do!)

I plan that every character has their own abilities and bonuses. Which I will not reveal :P
